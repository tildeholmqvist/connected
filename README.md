## Agile Methodology

To manage the development of this project, I used the GitHub projects for an agile approach. 
You can view the projectboard
[here.](https://github.com/users/tildeholmqvist/projects/9)

The 6 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.
